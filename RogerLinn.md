# The Roger Linn Sequencer: Design Principles

A Technical Reference for Sequencer Engine Development (macOS / iOS)

The Roger Linn design trajectory—from the LM-1 (1980) through the LinnDrum, Linn 9000, and MPC 60—illustrates a relentless pursuit of a "human" feel within a rigid digital environment. This document distills the **sequencer-specific** principles: timing, resolution, swing, shuffle, MIDI, patterns, and multi-track architecture. It omits sampling, audio, and sound engine concerns—focusing solely on the sequencing of notes into musical patterns.

## Core Design Philosophy

The significance of these designs lies in their rejection of the "mechanical" nature of early computer music. By introducing **quantization**, **shuffle**, and **velocity-sensitive input**, Roger Linn gave musicians a way to record their soul into a machine. The core principles remain: prioritization of human feel through clever digital architecture and deterministic timing logic.

## The LM-1: Foundations of Sequencer Architecture

The LM-1 (1980) introduced the first programmable drum machine. Its sequencer architecture established concepts that persist today.

### Quantization ("Timing Correct")

Quantization was discovered as a functional byproduct of memory conservation; the first prototypes only permitted recording in 16th note increments to save RAM. When Linn tested the unit, he realized that his own imperfect timing was being snapped to a perfect grid—a "bug" that he immediately rebranded as a core feature.

### Shuffle / Swing

The LM-1 introduced the "shuffle" or "swing" parameter. By implementing a variable delay to the second 16th note in an 8th note pair, Linn allowed the machine to move beyond a mechanical metronome feel to a triplet-based groove.

### LM-1 Sequencer Specifications

| Component | Specification | Technical Significance |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|
| CPU | Zilog Z80 | Standard 8-bit processing for sequence logic |
| Sequencer Resolution | 48 PPQN | Introduced the first "timing correct" logic |

---

## The LinnDrum: Refined Timing and Resolution

The LinnDrum (1982) standardized the workflow for the professional studio. It improved upon the LM-1 with a more intuitive interface for **pattern chaining** and **song creation**.

### Clock and Resolution

The LinnDrum utilized a Zilog Z80 microprocessor for sequencing. The timing clock was generated by an RC-controlled oscillator (LM556) that could vary the frequency from approximately 60 Hz to 300 Hz. This internal clock was divided to determine the duration of a 1/192 note, achieving a resolution of **48 PPQN** (pulses per quarter note).

### I/O for Sequencing

| Technical Detail | LinnDrum Architecture |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Processing Unit | Zilog Z80 8-bit CPU |
| Clock Generator | LM556 RC Oscillator |
| I/O Connectivity | MIDI (Later models), Sync Tone, Trigger In/Out |
| Resolution | 48 PPQN (Pulses Per Quarter Note) |

Producers began demanding the ability to **sequence external synthesizers** alongside drum patterns, leading Linn to conceptualize a multi-track, integrated system.

## The Linn 9000: Multi-Track MIDI Workstation

The Linn 9000 (1984) combined a **32-track MIDI sequencer** with velocity-sensitive pads in a single workstation. This was the first machine to treat MIDI sequencing and drum pattern programming as part of a unified environment.

### Sequencer Capabilities

| Feature | Linn 9000 Capability |
|---------|---------------------|
| Sequencer | 32 tracks, 60,000 note capacity |
| Polyphony | 18 Voices (multitimbral) |
| Pads | 18 Velocity and Pressure Sensitive |
| Display | 2×16 LCD (Original), Tiltable |

### Note Repeat and MIDI Expression

The user interface introduced features that would define the MPC series:

- **Note Repeat:** Holding timing correction and applying pressure to a pad would trigger rhythmic repeats at the selected quantize value.
- **Velocity and Pressure:** Pads sensitive to strike velocity and continuous pressure, mapped to MIDI note-on velocity and aftertouch.

### Software Stability Lessons

The Linn 9000 was notorious for software bugs—locking up during intense sequencing tasks and losing session work. The lesson: **timing and sequencer interrupts must have highest priority** in the OS. Predictability of timing (lack of jitter) is more important for "feel" than absolute latency.

## The Final Linn Era: LinnSequencer and Midistudio

| Model | Release Year | Primary Innovation |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| Linn 9000 | 1984 | First Workstation (MIDI + Multi-Track + Pads) |
| LinnSequencer | 1985 | Dedicated 32-Track Rack-Mount MIDI Sequencer |
| LinnDrum Midistudio | 1986 | Introduced the 4×4 Pad Grid Layout |

The LinnSequencer was a dedicated 32-track rack-mount MIDI sequencer. The Midistudio introduced the **4×4 pad layout** that would become the hallmark of the MPC 60.

---

## The MPC 60: Timing Perfection

The Akai MPC 60 (1988) perfected the reliability and timing required for the sequencer to become a global standard.

### Architectural Priorities

The operating system was rewritten to **prioritize timing**. Linn noted that great care was taken to ensure that the MIDI clock and internal sequencer interrupts were given the highest priority in the OS, ensuring a "solid" feel even under heavy CPU loads.

### Resolution Upgrade

The sequencer resolution was increased to **96 PPQN**, providing a more detailed rhythmic grid for capturing subtle human nuances in timing. Compared to early Roland sequencers at 24 PPQN, the higher resolution makes the deterministic swing feel more organic.

### MPC 60 Sequencer Specifications

| Component | Specification | Role |
|-----------|---------------|------|
| CPU | Intel 80186 (10 MHz) | Timing and Sequence Management |
| Resolution | 96 PPQN | Rhythmic grid for human feel |

---

## Rhythmic Logic: The Mathematics of Swing

The defining characteristic of a Roger Linn sequencer is its "groove." This is not randomization—it is a **deterministic mathematical manipulation** of the timing grid.

### The Swing Algorithm

Linn's swing works by **delaying the even-numbered subdivisions** of the beat. If we define *T_beat* as the duration of a quarter note, and *n* as the number of pulses per quarter note (PPQN), the time for a standard subdivision is:

$$T_{sub} = \frac{T_{beat}}{n}$$

In a 16th note grid, there are 4 subdivisions per beat. The even notes (2 and 4) are shifted later in time by a factor determined by the Swing percentage (*S*):

$$T_{delay} = \left( \frac{S - 50}{50} \right) \times T_{sub}$$

Where *S* ranges from 50 (no swing) to 75. At **66% swing**, the first note of a pair takes two-thirds of the time and the second takes one-third—a perfect triplet feel.

### Swing Percentage Reference

| Swing % | Musical Equivalent | Rhythmic Feel |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| 50% | Straight 16th Notes | Mechanical, rigid |
| 54% - 58% | "The Shuffle" | Loosens the beat without sounding like swing |
| 62% | Traditional Hip-Hop Swing | The "MPC Groove" |
| 66% | Perfect Triplet | Standard Jazz/Blues swing |
| 75% | Dotted 8th - 16th | Heavy, "galloping" rhythm |

## Software Evolution: MIDI and Sequence Data

The MPC 60 software evolution added sequencer-focused features:

- **MIDI File Support:** Load and save Standard MIDI Files (SMF), enabling cross-platform sequence transfer.
- **Project/Sequence Storage:** Persistence of patterns, sequences, and song arrangements.

---

## Tactile Interface: Velocity and Note Input

The 16 velocity-sensitive pads on the MPC 60 were a refinement of the 18 pads on the Linn 9000. For a sequencer engine, the relevant concepts are:

| Pad Feature | Technical Mechanism | Sequencer Impact |
|-------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Velocity Sensitivity | Strike force → MIDI velocity | Dynamic control over note velocity |
| Pressure (Aftertouch) | Continuous pressure → MIDI CC | Real-time modulation of notes |
| Note Repeat | Logic-based rhythmic retrigger | Rapid rolls at quantize value |
| 4 Pad Banks | Logic mapping to 64 note slots | Expanded note palette per pattern |

---

## Modern Continuation: Clock Priority and Jitter

The LinnStrument demonstrates the continued importance of **clock priority**. Its sensor scanning logic minimizes jitter and latency. The firmware addresses each pad sequentially with predictable timing. The philosophy: **predictability of delay (lack of jitter)** is more important for the "feel" of an instrument than absolute latency.

---

## Summary: Principles for Sequencer Engine Development

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Resolution** | 48 PPQN minimum; 96 PPQN preferred for organic feel |
| **Quantization** | Grid snap with configurable subdivision (16th, 8th, etc.) |
| **Swing** | Deterministic delay on even subdivisions; S = 50–75% |
| **Timing Priority** | MIDI clock and sequencer interrupts at highest OS priority |
| **Jitter** | Minimize; predictability > absolute latency |
| **Multi-Track** | 32+ tracks; large note capacity (60,000+ notes) |
| **MIDI** | Full SMF support; velocity, aftertouch, program change |
| **Note Repeat** | Rhythmic retrigger at quantize value on Pad hold |
| **Patterns** | Pattern chaining, song arrangement, project persistence |

The trajectory is defined by the move from a specialized drum machine to a generalized music production center. The LM-1 and LinnDrum established quantization and swing; the Linn 9000 established the multi-track MIDI workflow; the MPC 60 perfected reliability and timing. For a Swift sequencer engine on macOS and iOS, these principles provide the architectural foundation.
